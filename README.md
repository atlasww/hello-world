hello-world
===========

this is my first git-hub project

My tag is atlasww. I'm fairly new to coding. At 40 years old I know it will be a tough road to travel, but here I am. Learning Python right now. I have about three months of that. And I started Javascript about three days ago. So, we'll see.
